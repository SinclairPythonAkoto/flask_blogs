# Flask Blog - Microservices

This is a simple Flak blog app within a microservices structure deployed from a docker container.
In this app I will create a Continuous Intergeration & Continuous Development process to automate my testing.

This app has a frontend and a backend which are both separate Flask apps, which use the same VE.
In the future the VE should be set up within each app directory.
